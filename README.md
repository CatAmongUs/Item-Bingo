<h1>Item Bingo Plugin</h1>
for Spigot 1.21.11

<h2>What does this plugin do?</h2>

This is for playing a Bingo minigame on your Spigot server.

The Bingo goals are all vanilla items that are obtainable in survival mode. 
To mark an item as found, you either craft it, pick it up or find it in a chest.
The first Team thal collects a full row, column or diagonal of items wins!

<h3>What kind of different items are there?</h3>
<ul>
<li>All vanilla items that are obtainable in survival mode can appear in the bingo card</li>
<li>Creative items like spawn eggs or command blocks don´t appear</li>
<li>Spawners and reinforced deepslate are made obtainable with silk touch contrary to vanilla mc. They can also appear on the bingo card</li>
<li>Potions (normal, lingering, splash) and tipped Arrows with all obtainable potion types</li>
<li>Each armor piece with every possible armor trim variation, <strong> these count as different items as the plain armor without trim</strong></li>
<li>Each enchantable item with every possible combination of enchantments</li>
<li>Ominous bottles, different levels are treated as different items, e.g. an ominous bottle with bad omen 2 is not the same as one with bad omen 5</li>
</ul>
<h3>When does an item count as equal to an item on the bingo card?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Durability is ignored</li>
<li>Stack count is ignored</li>
<li>The item must fulfill at least all properties of the corresponding item on the Bingo card</li>
<li><strong>Example: On the card, there is a diamond chestplate with thorns 1 and protection 3. Then a diamond chestplate with thorns 1, protection 3 and mending would count as the same item, while one with only protection 3 wouldn´t</strong></li>
</ul>
